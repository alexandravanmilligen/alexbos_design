                As in many industries, content management is a crucial component for those working in secondary education. Collecting, dispersing and interpreting content and data should be a seamless and efficient process. Education360 seeks to enhance the experience teachers, students and administrators by combining daily tasks into one, easy-to-manage platform.

                In this case, the client had a few general ideas riding on a hunch that the content management industry wasn’t tapped out. As a current teacher, I saw an open niche in the educational field. Educators at my school use over six platforms to manage various forms of content. This reduces efficiency and contributes to teacher burnout. According to a 2018 study, teachers are quitting at record rates. An easy-to-use content management system certainly isn’t a panacea, but it would absolutely make our lives easier, contributing to work-life balance and increasing face time with our kids.

                Education360 responds to the needs of today’s educator by combining tasks like attendance and lesson plan submission on a single, easy-to-use platform. Synced with a Google Account, teachers can post docs and slides created using Google Drive. They can also communicate and connect both internally and externally using their professional email accounts. One username. One password. One inbox. One place to store and access data. Education360 is a comprehensive content management tool to simplify and redefine teaching and learning.

                I began my research with user surveys and a detailed analysis of top competitors. Google Classroom provides a platform that allows internal but not external collaboration. It also leaves room for human error when teacher inevitably have to transfer data from one platform to the next. That said, the fact that it cooperates so effortlessly with live documents makes it a great way to manage the internal distribution of assignments. I also considered KIPP share (a platform used exclusively by my network to collaborate and share amongst other KIPP teachers) and Teachers Pay Teachers as competitors in the field of educational content managements. I came to the conclusion what teachers really need is a platform that allows us not only to manage student-facing work but also to interact with the thousands of other educators teaching our content. Features that allow teachers to track attendance, behavior, and grades in one place would eliminate redundancy.

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding">
              <p>
                Having compiled my research, I began to map and <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/f1LjNDL7fxr8BGoDejLSlEcU/Wireframes-van-Milligen">wireframe</a></span> my site using user stories as a guide. I tested my wireframes several times in order to ensure functionality before I moved to my high fidelity prototype.

            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col">

                After brainstorming and creating a vision board, I utilized principles of design to compile a brand story and <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/BoXiIXuhAutVhFwyo2VWM2Z4/Education-360-Logo-and-Typography">style guide</a></span>.  The color-scheme was chosen to evoke growth and progress without being over-stimulating. Even the accent color, a muted gold, has the capacity to notify/call to action without creating a panic.  Speaking from experience, KIPP teachers are vibrating on high for the majority of the day. Thus, the Education360 platform was designed to inspire and invigorate without causing additional stressors. One of my biggest challenging was designing a logo that was simultaneously recognizable, contemporary, and versatile. My logo went through several iterations before I ultimately settled on something simple, modern, monochromatic and geometric

            <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">Conclusion</h3>

              <p>
                Overall, this process really emphasized the iterative nature of design and the importance of the collaboration and testing.  I tested my product three times: once during the wireframe process, once after creating high fidelity mock-ups, and once through a <span><a target="_blank" href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/tests/fb8e3708df51/results/82d9679b7a2">preference test</a></span>. The colleagues who tested my work provided feedback that was invaluable; it’s so interesting how a shift in perspective illuminates gaps in layout and semantics that would otherwise go undetected. I appreciate the exposure to various tools as well.
                In addition, I continue to realize the importance of meticulous attention to detail. I’ve always considered myself to be a “big picture” person (which is something I think people say to absolve themselves of a lack of precision and attentiveness). Working hastily really slowed down my process in the long run--especially in crafting my high fidelity prototypes. Screens that had been copied and pasted had to be entirely redone. I’ve learned to pay more attention to margins, spacing and consistency. I’ve also learned that creating well-named groups on figma is a life-saver.
